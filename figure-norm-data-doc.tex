\section*{Abstract}
  In ranking problems, the goal is to learn a ranking function
  $r(\mathbf x)\in\RR$ from labeled pairs $\mathbf x,\mathbf x'$ of
  input points. We consider the related comparison
  problem, where the label $y\in\{-1,0,1\}$ indicates which element of
  the pair is better, or if there is no significant difference. We
  cast the learning problem as a margin maximization, and show that it
  can be solved by converting it to a standard SVM. We use simulated
  nonlinear patterns and a real learning to rank sushi data set to
  show that our proposed SVMcompare algorithm outperforms SVMrank when
  there are equality $y=0$ pairs.

\section*{The learning to compare problem}
\begin{itemize}
\item We have $n$ labeled training pairs $(\mathbf x_i, \mathbf x_i', y_i)$.
\item Input features $\mathbf x_i,\mathbf x_i'\in\RR^p$.
\item Output label $y_i\in\{-1,0,1\}$ indicates which element is better:
\end{itemize}
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:z}
  y_i =
  \begin{cases}
    -1 &  r(\mathbf x_i)>r(\mathbf x_i')
    \text{, $\mathbf x_i$ is better than $\mathbf x'_i$},\\
    0 & r(\mathbf x_i) = r(\mathbf x_i')
    \text{, $\mathbf x_i$ is as good as $\mathbf x'_i$},\\
    1 & r(\mathbf x_i)<r(\mathbf x_i')
    \text{, $\mathbf x'_i$ is better than $\mathbf x_i$}.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\section*{Example: movies}
  \textit{Les Mis\'erables} is better than \textit{Star Wars}\\
  $(\mathbf x_{\textit{Les Mis\'erables}}, \mathbf x_{\textit{Star Wars}}, -1)$\\
  \textit{The Empire Strikes Back} is as good as \textit{Star Wars}\\
  $(\mathbf x_{\textit{The Empire Strikes Back}}, \mathbf x_{\textit{Star Wars}}, 0)$\\
  Features $\mathbf x$ can be length in minutes, year of theatrical
  release, indicators for genre, actors/actresses, directors, etc.
